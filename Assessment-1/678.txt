6. Find the output of the following // Consider the compiler is 32-bit machine 

Size of Structure = sizeof(int) + sizeof(char) + sizeof(char) = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 bytes

output : Size of Structure = 6


7.Find the output of the following // Consider the compiler is 32-bit machine

Size of Structure = sizeof(char) + sizeof(double) + sizeof(char) = 1 + 8 + 1 = 10 bytes

Output : Size of Structure = 10

8.Find the output of the following // Consider the compiler is 32-bit machine

the given code is reversing the number 12345678

output: 87654321
