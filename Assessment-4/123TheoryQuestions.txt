1. Connection procedure in client-server communication:


a. first the server and client starts by creating an socket. -> socket() two types of sockets datagaram(UDP) and stream sockets (TCP)
b. The server binds to a well known address. -> bind()
c. server starts listening for incoming connections. -> listen()
c. The client initiates a connection request by specifying the server's address and port.->  connect()
d. The server accepts the connection request. -> accept()
e. Once the connection is established, data exchange can occur between the client and the server.->  send() recv()
f. After the communication is complete, either the client or the server can close the connection. 


2. Use of bind() function in socket programming:

-> In socket programming, the bind() function is used to associate a socket with a specific network address (IP address and port number). 
-> This is necessary for servers, as they need to specify the port they will be listening on. 
-> For clients, bind() is generally not used, as the operating system automatically assigns an available local port when the client initiates communication. 
-> Without bind(), the server wouldn't know which port to listen on.

3. Datagram Socket:

-> A datagram socket is a type of socket used in networking for sending and receiving packets of data known as datagrams. 
-> Datagram sockets operate independently of each other. 
-> They are connectionless, meaning there is no established connection before data transfer, and each packet is treated as an independent message.
